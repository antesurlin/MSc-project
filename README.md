# Using deep learning and machine learning for detecting landslide occurrence

For this project I used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Feed Forward Neural Netwrok and Long Short-Term Memory neural network
The main idea behind the project was to compare whether LSTM can achieve better results than other methods
